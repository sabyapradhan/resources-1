# Granting users access to tag resources	
{: #access}	
	
As the account owner, you might want to delegate some of the responsibility of tagging resources. To do that, you can grant access to other users in the account to add and remove tags from resources. For users on account to add tags to a resource, they must be assigned the appropriate access. Access to services that belong to a resource group are managed by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) access policies, and access to services that belong to a Cloud Foundry org and space are managed by Cloud Foundry org and space roles.

## Tagging permissions
{: #tagging-permissions}

Tags are visible to any user in an account. Once a resource is tagged, the tag is visible to all users who have read access to the resource. To add or remove a tag from a resource, certain access roles or permissions are required depending on the resource type. Check out the following table to understand what role is required for each resource type. 


| Resource Type | Role |
|--------|---------------|
| IAM-enabled | Editor or Administrator on the resource | 
| Cloud Foundry | Developer role on the space that the resource belongs to  | 
| Classic infrastructure*| View hardware details permission or view virtual server details permission |
| Cloud Object Storage S3 on classic infrastructure | Storage manage permission |

*The taggable resources in classic infrastructure are Virtual Guest, Virtual Dedicated Host, Network Application Delivery Controller, Gateway Member, Subnet, VLAN, and VLAN Firewall (Dedicated).
