# Searching for resources
{: #searching-for-resources}

You can search for provisioned resources that you expect to find in the resource list and offerings in the catalog from anywhere in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console. Enter the resource or tag in the search field from the console menu bar. You can also use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} command-line interface (CLI) to search across your resources. The CLI searches for distributed applications and service instances across locations and data centers.

<dd>Use this option to view a filtered resource list that automatically populates the name field within the resource list, giving you the most relevant results. The returned search displays the first 10 resource results. If you know that there are more results, you can see them all from the resource list. This option appears if it matches a resource result or tag search. If it doesn't match a resource result name or tag, it doesn't appear.</dd>

<dd>Use this option to view a filtered catalog search. The first five results are displayed by name. If you want a more detailed search criteria for catalog entries, such as searching the description, you can click this link and get a filtered catalog results view. This option helps you find the offerings that you want to create faster. This appears if it matches to a catalog result. This field doesn't appear if your search query starts with `tag:`.</dd>
<dt>Search support cases</dt>
<dd>Use this option to filter by your open support cases across the platform, including infrastructure resources. This shows up at the end of the search if you search for anything, including if you search by `tag:`.</dd>
