## Service deprecation
{: #service_deprecation}

IBM provides at least 30 days notice of its intention to discontinue or replace a generally available service. If an equivalent replacement isn't provided, for at least 12 months from the date of that announcement, IBM uses commercially reasonable means to continue the operation and support of previously deployed instances of the service.
