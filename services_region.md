# Service availability
{: #services_region}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} makes it easy for you to implement, host, and scale services and apps. You can focus on your application logic and application design.
{:shortdesc}

Not all services are available for purchase in every {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} location. And, even if the service is available to purchase in that location, the service might be hosted in a different location. The following table shows the services that are provided by IBM. For the full list of resources that are available, see the [catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

Services that are hosted globally create resources that operate across multiple locations. For example, with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, you can choose to disperse data across a single [data center](/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#data_center), or even a combination of locations by [selecting the endpoint](/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/basics?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-availability#service-availability) where your application sends REST API requests.

<!-- Do not manually change the table or add content after the table. -->
<!-- The tables and everything after are deleted and refreshed daily. -->
<!-- Also, do not change the number of dashes in the second line. -->
<!-- Ping @natimpe for details. -->
