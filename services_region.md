# Service  and infrastructure availability
{: #services_region}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} makes it easy for you to implement, host, and scale services, infrastructure, and apps so you can focus on your application logic and application design.
{:shortdesc}

Not all services and infrastructure are available for purchase in every {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} location. 

## Services
{: #paas-services}

Some services are available to purchase in a location, but that service might be hosted in a different location. The following table shows the services that are provided by IBM. For the full list of resources that are available, see the [catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

Services that are hosted globally create resources that operate across multiple locations. For example, with {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, you can choose to deploy data in a single data center, or even a combination of locations by selecting the endpoint where your application sends REST API requests.

<!-- Do not manually change the table or add content after the table. -->
<!-- The tables and everything after are deleted and refreshed daily. -->
<!-- Also, do not change the number of dashes in the second line. -->
<!-- Ping @natimpe for details. -->

<!-- Everything is deleted after this line. -->

## Infrastructure
{: #iaas-service-infra}

Infrastructure services are available to be deployed in data centers. Each column header that ends with a number represents a data center or multi-zone region (MZR). Columns marked (MZR) represent a location where resources are automatically deployed and managed across several data centers.

### Americas
{: #iaas-service-americas}

The following infrastructure resources are available in North and South America. Match the resource row with the column representing the data center or multi-zone region. A check mark indicates the resource is available in that location. The Dallas (MZR) and Washington DC (MZR) columns represent multi-zone regions where deployment is managed automatically across several data centers.
